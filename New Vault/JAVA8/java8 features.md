## Features introduced in Java 8

Java 8 introduced several new features and improvements to the Java language, including:

1. **Lambda expressions**, which allow developers to write concise, functional code.
2. **Stream API**, which allows developers to perform functional-style operations on collections of data.
3. **Method references**, which allow developers to use shorthand notation for referring to methods.
4. **Functional interfaces**, which are interfaces that have a single abstract method.
5. **Optional class**, which is a container class for an optional value.
6. **Date and Time API**, which was completely redesigned and allows for improved handling of date and time values.
7. **Default methods**, give us the ability to add full implementations in interfaces besides abstract methods
8. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**, which allows developers to run JavaScript code within a Java program

## Objectives of  java 8

1. To simplify programming.
2. To utilize functional programming benefits in java such as lambda ,functional interface
3. to enable **parallel programming**.
4. Enhancing the Java standard library, particularly in the areas of date and time manipulation.
